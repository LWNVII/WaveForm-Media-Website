        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <div class="container-fluid">
          <p>I've been producing over year now in both Ableton Live 11, and FL Studio with a numerous collection of compositions, songs, instrumentals, and experiments ranging genres from trap, to Future Bass, to orchestral, to ambient, to indie and more. <br><br>However, I've been playing music for over 8 years of the time of writing, starting with drums. I've played in jazz and symphonic bands while learning, and on my own pursued playing rock, hiphop, neosoul, metal and more on the drum set. I played with friends and family, and had a plethora of opportunities which I owe my diverse set of inspirations to. <br><br>I later would move on to learn guitar, piano, ukulele, and bass to varying degree, and today my main focus has been guitar and music production. <br><br>Throughout all my life, I've had a interest in many genres and have pursued genres at every end of the spectrum, and with that, I'm constantly seeking to innovate and reinvent my own sound, explore new sonic pallettes, and create meaningful and through provoking pieces that people of all sorts of tastes can enjoy.</p>
